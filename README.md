# üöÄ Secure OAuth2 Login Demo with Spring Boot 3.3.5, Java 17, and OAuth2 

### ‚ö†Ô∏è **Note**: This app is **still a work in progress** and is being built step by step. The features listed below are part of the roadmap for future development. 

---

## üìù To-Do List

The app is being built in phases, so here‚Äôs a breakdown of the features I'm working on:

### 1. **Multi-Provider Authentication** üîë
- [x] **Add Multiple OAuth Providers**  
  - Integrate Google and GitHub OAuth2 for login options.
- [ ] **Unified Registration/Login Flow**  
  - Implement a smooth user registration and login flow that works with all connected OAuth providers.
- [ ] **Account Linking**  
  - Let users link accounts from different OAuth providers to use one account for multiple logins.
- [ ] **Custom Error Handling**  
  - Handle errors like invalid logins and session expirations with nice custom error pages.  
  *(Check out [Spring OAuth2 Guide](https://spring.io/guides/tutorials/spring-boot-oauth2) for more.)*

### 2. **Advanced Authorization** üõ°Ô∏è
- [ ] **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**  
  - Add roles (Admin, User, etc.) to control who can access what.
- [ ] **Custom Permissions**  
  - Create custom permissions for more granular access control.
- [ ] **Method-Level Security**  
  - Use annotations like `@PreAuthorize` and `@Secured` to protect methods.
- [ ] **Dynamic Permission Evaluation**  
  - Develop logic to evaluate permissions dynamically based on user roles, attributes, or context.

### 3. **Token Management** ü™ô
- [ ] **JWT Token Generation**  
  - Create and manage JWT tokens for stateless authentication.
- [ ] **Refresh Token Support**  
  - Add refresh tokens so users don‚Äôt need to log in all the time.
- [ ] **Token Revocation**  
  - Plan for securely revoking tokens when necessary (e.g., on suspicious activity).
- [ ] **Secure Token Storage**  
  - Ensure tokens are stored safely (e.g., using HttpOnly cookies).

### 4. **User Management Enhancements** üë§
- [ ] **User Profiles**  
  - Build a user profile system where users can update their info.
- [ ] **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)**  
  - Add MFA for an extra layer of security (because why not make things even safer?).
- [ ] **Password Reset Flow**  
  - Implement secure password reset via email with token validation.
- [ ] **Audit Logging**  
  - Log important events like logins and password changes for security auditing.

### 5. **Security Hardening** üîí
- [ ] **Rate Limiting on Auth Endpoints**  
  - Add rate limiting to prevent brute-force attacks on login endpoints.
- [ ] **Advanced Threat Detection**  
  - Build mechanisms to detect and respond to suspicious activities (e.g., failed login attempts).
- [ ] **Custom Failure Handlers**  
  - Handle authentication failures with custom messages and behaviors (e.g., account lockouts after too many failed attempts).
- [ ] **Force HTTPS & Secure Cookies**  
  - Make sure all connections use HTTPS and cookies are secure & HttpOnly.

### 6. **Advanced Features** üåü
- [ ] **Single Sign-On (SSO)**  
  - Implement SSO for seamless login across multiple apps or services.
- [ ] **Enterprise User Provisioning**  
  - Integrate with enterprise systems (Active Directory, LDAP) for user management at scale.
- [ ] **Consent Management**  
  - Allow users to choose which data they want to share with the app.
- [ ] **Social Graph/Connection Tracking**  
  - Build a social graph to track user connections and relationships.

### 7. **Monitoring & Observability** üìä
- [ ] **Authentication Metrics**  
  - Track metrics like login success rates and failed attempts.
- [ ] **Comprehensive Logging**  
  - Set up detailed logs to monitor authentication events (e.g., logins, logouts).
- [ ] **Custom Authentication Events**  
  - Create custom events for important authentication actions (e.g., password changes).
- [ ] **Distributed Tracing**  
  - Implement tracing to follow authentication requests across microservices.
